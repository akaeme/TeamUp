# TeamUp

TeamUp was developed at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt) in the course [Services Engineering](http://www.ua.pt/ensino/uc/6304) for academic purposes and intents intentions to build a mobile application, adopting a service-oriented architecture as a paradigm of design.

# Motivation
TeamUp came about when, at the beginning of the semester, we felt a problem in scheduling meetings between friends to play football. We move the problem to the service engineering curricular unit with the main objective being to design an application to facilitate the marking of events of various types including trying to solve all the problems that derive from the scheduling of events between people.
Our proposal was based on the construction of a mobile application where the functionality is specific to each service, following a service oriented architecture,  pointing to a total modularity between them excluding any dependency. The proposal has undergone some changes according to the new concepts addressed in the theoretical part.

# System Features
* Easy and efficient communication between the participants.
* Easy searching of activities by distance, activity and zone.
* Weather information according to the event schedule.
* Maximum and minimum number of participants to ensure the success of an activity/event.
* Public and private events.
* Easy registration and login with Facebook
* Schedule and location voting process.
